DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a system that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. When you connect a device (like a computer or smartphone) to a Wi-Fi network, DHCP gives it a unique IP address so it can communicate with other devices and access the internet. This process happens automatically, so you donâ€™t have to set up the IP address manually.

Install the `isc-dhcp-server` packet.

Navigate to the */etc/dhcp/* directory and make a copy of the `dhcpd.conf` file.

Then, edit the */etc/dhcp/[dhcpd.conf](/images/dhcpd.conf.png)* file:
```
subnet 10.0.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 10.0.2.100 10.0.2.200;
	option domain-name-servers 10.0.2.10;
	option routers 10.0.2.1;
}
```

Check the */etc/default/isc-dhcp-server* file and edit it. Make sure to comment-out the INTERFACESv6 and add the interface you are using in INTERFACESv4.

Restart the service: `sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart`
